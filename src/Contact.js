      Hello I am Rishabh Pillai, and this is my food delivery website project I made using MERN stack. I used twilio api for the otp function, and hopefully i am able to use stripe to create a payment method through which people can actually checkout, that way the app is now truly complete. If there are any bugs or issues or that I should add more features, please let me know. I am open to any feedback and suggestions. Thank you.
