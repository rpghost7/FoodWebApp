      Hello I am Rishabh Pillai, and this is my food delivery website project I made using MERN stack. I used twilio api for the otp function, and i have made a payment gateway using paypal sandbox which gives a testing ground, although i could only find the api for US based transactions so all the transactions will be in dollars and if you want to test it, create a sandbox personal account which is US based and it should work. If there are any bugs or issues or that I should add more features, please let me know. I am open to any feedback and suggestions. Thank you.
