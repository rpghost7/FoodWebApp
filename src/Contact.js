      Hello I am Rishabh Pillai, and this is my food delivery website project I made using MERN stack. I used twilio api for the otp function, and I tried making a payment gateway using stripe,paypal and razorpay but each of them require me to make a business account which is not possible for me. If there are any bugs or issues or that I should add more features, please let me know. I am open to any feedback and suggestions. Thank you.
